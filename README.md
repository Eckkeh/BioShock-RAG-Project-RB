# BioShock-RAG-Project-RB

# Reflection Report

## Overview of the Document
For this project, I extracted content from Wikipedia pages related to *BioShock*, including the main game page and the character page. These sources provide insights into the game’s development, storyline, key figures, and world-building elements. The retrieved information helps improve the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## How the Program Works
To better understand the program’s functionality, I analyzed its workflow step by step:

### 1. Retrieving and Preparing the Document
- The program fetches *BioShock*-related content from Wikipedia.
- **BeautifulSoup** is used to scrape and clean the extracted text.
- The cleaned text is saved into a file called `Selected_Document.txt`.

### 2. Processing and Structuring the Text
- The content of `Selected_Document.txt` is read and split into smaller sections.
- These sections are divided using double newline characters (`\n\n`) to preserve logical groupings.

### 3. Creating Text Embeddings
- The **SentenceTransformers** library converts each text chunk into a numerical representation (embedding).
- These embeddings are stored in a dictionary, linking each chunk to its corresponding vector representation.
- The embeddings enable efficient similarity comparisons between the user’s query and document content.

### 4. Handling User Queries
- When a user submits a query, it is also transformed into an embedding using the same model.
- The program calculates cosine similarity between the query embedding and the document embeddings.
- The three most relevant chunks, based on similarity scores, are selected for retrieval.

### 5. Generating a Response
- The retrieved text chunks are passed to a **HuggingFace** model (`flan-t5-small`).
- The model generates a response by combining the user’s query with the retrieved context.
- The final answer is displayed to the user.

### 6. Testing and Evaluating Performance
- Various test queries are used to assess how well the system retrieves and generates responses.
- The accuracy and relevance of outputs are reviewed to identify areas for improvement.

## Key Questions and Insights
To deepen my understanding of the program’s core concepts, I explored the following questions:

### 1. What is cosine similarity, and why is it important?
Cosine similarity measures how closely related two vectors are by analyzing the angle between them. This technique helps the program identify which document chunks are most relevant to a given query.

### 2. What role does sentence-transformers play in the system?
**Sentence-transformers** converts text into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings), enabling efficient retrieval based on meaning rather than exact wording.

### 3. How does RAG ensure responses remain contextually relevant?
RAG improves response accuracy by retrieving relevant source material before generating an answer, preventing the model from relying solely on pre-trained knowledge.

### 4. What are embeddings, and why are they useful?
Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning, making it easier for the system to compare and rank document chunks effectively.

### 5. How does the HuggingFace model generate responses?
The HuggingFace model (`flan-t5-small`) processes both the user’s query and the retrieved text to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

## Performance Evaluation

### 1. Effectiveness of Retrieval
- The system consistently retrieves relevant chunks of text for most queries.
- Cosine similarity helps rank document sections based on their contextual relevance.

### 2. Accuracy of Generated Responses
- The answers are generally accurate and grounded in retrieved text.
- Some responses lack depth or precision, highlighting areas for potential refinement.

## Potential Enhancements
- **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Training the HuggingFace model with more *BioShock*-specific data could improve response quality.
- **Optimizing the Retrieval Mechanism**: Using **FAISS** or **Pinecone** for vector search might enhance retrieval speed and accuracy.
- **Refining the Chunking Strategy**: Implementing semantic-based chunking instead of fixed-length splits could preserve context better.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A graphical interface would make the system more accessible to users without technical expertise.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project effectively demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation can be used to extract and generate contextually accurate answers about *BioShock*. By combining embeddings, cosine similarity, and a language model, the system provides insightful and relevant responses, with room for further optimization.
